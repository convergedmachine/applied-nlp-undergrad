## Course Overview
This hands-on programming series bridges the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP) theory and real-world applications. Students will gain practical NLP skills through interactive coding exercises and projects, focusing on tasks like text analysis, sentiment classification, named entity recognition, and topic modeling.

---

## Aim & Audience
Designed for undergraduate students with basic programming skills (e.g., Python) and an interest in AI and language processing, this course combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation. It equips learners to build and deploy NLP models for real-world problems.

## Schedule
The course is structured into modules, each focusing on key NLP concepts and techniques. Below is the schedule with corresponding Jupyter notebooks and exercises:
