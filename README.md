## Course Overview
This hands-on programming series bridges the gap between Natural Language Processing (NLP) theory and real-world applications. Students will gain practical NLP skills through interactive coding exercises and projects, focusing on tasks like text analysis, sentiment classification, named entity recognition, and topic modeling.

---

## Aim & Audience
Designed for undergraduate students with basic programming skills (e.g., Python) and an interest in AI and language processing, this course combines theoretical foundations with practical implementation. It equips learners to build and deploy NLP models for real-world problems.

## Schedule
The course is structured into modules, each focusing on key NLP concepts and techniques. Below is the schedule with corresponding Jupyter notebooks and exercises:

| Module | Topic | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 1 | **Text Preprocessing & Feature Extraction** | Learn to identify distinctive terms using statistical tests. |
| 2 | **Sentiment Analysis with Dictionaries** | Plot sentiment over time using human-defined dictionaries. |
| 3 | **Text Classification** | Gather data, engineer features, analyze feature weights, and explore hyperparameters for text classification. |
| 4 | **Text Regression** | Apply linear regression with L1/L2 regularization for tasks like box office prediction. |
| 5 | **Statistical Testing** | Estimate confidence intervals and perform hypothesis testing. |
| 6 | **Word Embeddings** | Build and explore high-dimensional, sparse word representations using distributional hypothesis and TF-IDF scaling. Implement semantic orientation methods. |
| 7 | **Neural Networks for NLP** | Explore MLP, CNN, LSTM, and attention mechanisms for text classification and document classification. |
| 8 | **Annotation Metrics** | Calculate inter-annotator agreement using Cohen's kappa and Krippendorff's alpha. |
| 9 | **WordNet & Word Sense Disambiguation** | Explore WordNet synsets, implement Lesk algorithm, and retrofit word vectors. |
| 10 | **POS Tagging & Keyphrase Extraction** | Understand Penn Treebank POS tags and extract keyphrases using TF-IDF and POS filtering. |
| 11 | **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** | Extract social networks, perform Twitter NER with BiLSTM, and resolve toponyms for visualization. |
| 12 | **Syntactic Analysis** | Use dependency parsing to analyze actions and objects associated with characters. |
| 13 | **Coreference Resolution** | Install neuralcoref and generate timelines from Wikipedia biographies. |
| 14 | **Topic Modeling** | Discover themes in movie summaries using topic modeling. |
